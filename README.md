# ChessAi

This project is a chess engine.
It uses a [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) for move evaluation with [alpha beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning).

The engine can play as both colors, with incode parameters to play with a human or against another engine.
The engine takes the first few moves by the book, with option to turn change the number of book moves.
